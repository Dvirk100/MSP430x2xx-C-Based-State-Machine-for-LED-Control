# MSP430x2xx-Embedded-C-State-Machine-Driven-LED-Control-and-Display

This project implements an embedded C program for the Texas Instruments MSP430x2xx microcontroller family using a finite state machine (FSM) architecture to control and display LEDs.

The FSM design allows for modularity and efficient handling of user input from four pushbuttons to execute different LED operations.
